# ApollonianSpheres

END GOAL: We want a 2D representation of the Apollonian Spheres. Given three initial circles, each iteration will add
the next group of circles tangent to the previous three that created it. The GUI is the 2D representation.

At the moment, we have the three initial circles and their location. We know how to calculate the radius of the 
inner/outer circle, we have them. We just now have to figure out how to get their location, find their center point,
for them using the math doc that Rachel wrote. - Janine

Met as a group. Worked on getting location of inner/outer spheres, setting up interface, and figuring out 3 topics/methods 
learned in class. - Janine

Met with Professor and figured out how to get location of inner/outer cirlce. Created separate methods for find the location
of any circle and a separate method for iteration 1 which is a special case. Need to implement 3 topics/method learned in class
and how to get further iterations. - Janine

Code is now fully functional! Change globale varible "iteration" to change which iteration you would like to see and
change the initial three circles location and radius to get a different size. - Janine
