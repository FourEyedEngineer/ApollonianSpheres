# ApollonianSpheres

END GOAL: We want a 2D representation of the Apollonian Spheres. Given three initial circles, each iteration will add
the next group of circles tangent to the previous three that created it. The GUI is the 2D representation...

At the moment, we have the three initial circles and their location. We know how to calculate the radius of the 
inner/outer circle, we have them. We just now have to figure out how to get their location, find their center point,
for them using the math doc that Rachel wrote. - Janine
